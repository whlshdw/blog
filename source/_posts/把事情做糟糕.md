>克服生活中的优柔寡断和缺乏控制的一个方法，就是把它做得很糟糕。

第一种是感觉自己掌控了自己的生活，那些感觉自己能更好地掌控自己生活的人有更好的心理健康。

如果你觉得自己对生活缺乏控制力，那么研究表明，你应该参加那些能让你更有控制力的经历。

你是否有时发现你推迟开始做某件事是因为你觉得自己还没有准备好?

你觉得很难决定穿什么，吃什么，跟谁约会，做什么工作吗?

你是否经常浪费很多时间来决定要做什么，而最终却一事无成?

克服生活中的优柔寡断和缺乏控制的一个方法，就是把它做得很糟糕。

GK 切斯特顿曾说过: “**任何值得做的事，第一次就值得搞砸。**”

这种方法如此有效的原因是，它能加快你的决策速度，让你立即行动起来，否则，你就会花上几个小时来决定你应该如何去做某事或你应该做什么。这会让你麻痹，甚至害怕开始。

很多时候，我们追求完美，却从来没做过一件事，因为我们给自己定的标准太高了。这些标准让我们望而生畏，让我们压力山大，所以我们推迟开始做某件事，甚至可能放弃整个事情。

做得不好，你就会有更多的时间去采取行动。我的意思是，你知道这是怎么回事: 很多时候，我们想要做一件完美的事情，我们不能开始，直到最完美的时间，直到我们掌握了所有的技能，但这可能是畏缩和压力。

所以不要一开始就去做，不要担心它是好是坏? 这样做会让你更容易开始做一件事，当你做得很糟糕的时候就能把它完成。当你回头看的时候，你会发现其实事情并没有那么糟糕。

我的一位患焦虑症的密友开始用这句话，她说: “当我开始用这句话时，我的生活发生了改变。” 我发现我可以在比以前更短的时间内完成任务。做得不好给了我冒险的动力，尝试不同的东西，并在整个过程中获得更多乐趣。它消除了一切焦虑，取而代之的是兴奋。”

所以，把它做得不好，你就可以随着你的进步而进步。

如果今天就开始用这句座右铭，生活将会发生怎样的变化 ?



**原文**：

**You** can take charge of your anxiety and lower it, which I think is so empowering. Today I'll be talking about three coping resources, and the first one is feeling like you're in control of your life. People who feel like they're more in control of their life have better mental health. If you feel like you're lacking in control in life, then reseach shows that you should engage in experiences that give you greater control. I'll show what I mean: do you sometimes find that you put off starting something beacause you just don't feel ready enough? Do you find it hard to make decisions like what to wear, what to eat who to date, which job to take up? Do you tend to waste a lot of time deciding what you might do while nothing gets done? A way to overcome indecision and this lack of control in life, is to do it badly. There's a quote by writer and poet GK Chesterton that says, "**Anything worth doing is worth doing badly the first time.**" The reason why this works so well is that it speeds up your decision-making and catapults you straight into action, otherwise, you can spend hours deciding how you should go about doing something or what you should do. This can be paralyzing and can make you afraid to even begin. All too often, we aim for perfection, but never end up doing anything because the standards that we set for ourselves are too high, they're intimidating, which stresses us out so we delay starting someting, or we might even abandon the whole thing altogether. Do it badly frees you up to take action.

**I** mean you know how it is : so often, we want to do something perfectly we can't start until it's the perfect time, until we've got all the skills, but this can be daunting and stressful. so way not just jump into it just do it however, without worrying if it's good or bad? 

**This** will make it that much easier to start someting and as you're doing it badly to finish it, and when you look back, you'll realize, more often than not, that actuall it's not that bad. A close friend of mine who has anxiety started using this motto, and this is what she said, "When I starte d using this motto, my life transformed. I found I could complete tasks in much shorter time periods than before. Do it badly gavae me wings to take risks, to try someting differently and to have way more fun during the whole process. It took the anxiety out of everything and replaced it with excitement. " 

**So** do it badly, and you can improve as you go along. I'd like to ask you to think about this: if you start using this motto today, how would your life change?
